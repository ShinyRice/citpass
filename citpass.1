is a simple password manager, keeping each password along with relevant metadata inside
an encrypted file within a directory residing by default at
.IR ~/.local/share/citpass .
Password files' names are randomized, and an encrypted index file residing within said directory
points the user towards the desired password.
It provides a series of commands in order to allow the user to add, remove, and list passwords.
